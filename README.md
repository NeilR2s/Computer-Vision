# Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of image processing and computer vision projects implemented in Jupyter Notebooks. The projects cover various topics, including denoising, edge detection, color space transformations, image enhancement, and segmentation.

## Projects

- **Denoising** – Techniques for removing noise from images.
- **HSV Interpolation & Translation** – Operations in the HSV color space.
- **Image Enhancement** – Improving image quality through various enhancement techniques.
- **Image Segmentation** – Partitioning images into meaningful segments and applying edge detection.
- **Midterm** – A comprehensive project combining multiple techniques.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (the project was built with Python 3.10+, although some backward compatibility may exist)
- `numpy>=1.22.0`
- `opencv-python>=4.5.5`
- `matplotlib>=3.5.0`
- `sewar>=0.4.5`
- `scikit-image>=0.19.0`
- `Pillow>=9.0.0`

To install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeilR2s/Computer-Vision.git
